# Symmetrical-Components
A method to simplify fault analysis by breaking down an unbalanced sets of phasors to a balanced system of positive, negative and zero sequence components

Symmetrical components are used in the analysis of power system faults by converting a set of unbalanced phasors. These phasors are known as positive, negative and zero sequence components.

This program exceutes the following:
* Converts phase quantities to the sequence quantities for any fault type
* Converts the phase quantities to the sequence quantities for phase A, phase B and Phase C
* Plots the positive, negative and zero sequence components in relation to the phase quantities
